## Hard (Expert level)

29. **dot-dsl** - Domain-specific language implementation with builder pattern
30. **doubly-linked-list** - Unsafe Rust memory management with raw pointers, Send/Sync traits

## Ranking Criteria

Tasks are ranked based on:

- **Algorithmic Complexity**: Simple iteration vs complex algorithms (search, optimization, parsing)
- **Rust Concepts**: Basic syntax vs advanced features (unsafe, lifetimes, macros, traits)
- **Domain Knowledge**: General programming vs specialized knowledge (music theory, cryptography)
- **Implementation Challenges**: Straightforward vs requiring careful design decisions
- **Error Handling**: Simple validation vs complex edge cases
- **Memory Management**: Safe Rust vs unsafe operations with raw pointers

The hardest tasks (dot-dsl, doubly-linked-list) require deep understanding of Rust's advanced features like unsafe code, lifetime management, and complex trait implementations.
